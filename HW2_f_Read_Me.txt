We can see from the model behaviour and from
the table in HW2_f that:

1. Addition of squared and cubed terms
don't improve model accuracy noticeably

2. Their addition, leads to their statistical
relevance without improving prediction accuracy.


Thus we conclude:

1. There isn't a legitimate reason to add them
2. There doesn't seem much evidence of a non-linear
association between output or any of the predictors,
when taken individually.
3. We can use the linear only model, thus.
