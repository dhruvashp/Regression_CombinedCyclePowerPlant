# Regression_CombinedCyclePowerPlant

As the repository name suggest, the code performs Regression on a Combined Cycle Power Plant Dataset. Both Linear Regression and KNN Regression has been performed here. This was done in regards to Fall 2020 course DSCI 552 taken at USC under Prof. Rajati, and the coding was done the same time. 

Since the original submission was in a private repository for this course, I re-organized the files and commited them again around Spring 2021
